# NWCHEM DFT for molecular descriptors of anions

Each anion was geometrically optimized at its neutral charge, -z charges (-1 for monovalent like F, or -1/-2 for divalent like SO4), and in its protonated state.

- HOMO and LUMO energies were extracted each charge state or protonated state.

- The electron affinities (EAs) were computed as [E(neutral charge) minus E(negative charge)]

- The homolytic deprotonation energy was computed as [E(neutral charge) + E(proton) - E(protonated state)]
