# GC-DFT geometric optimization in JDFTx (https://jdftx.org/)

## 1) Surfaces:

a) We included all optimized geometries of adsorbates (and bare surface) for 9 transition metals at 3 different applied potentials.

b) All geometries were saved as <ionpos>, a JDFTx-native format. This can directly be parsed into <dft.in> input file (also included) for JDFTx run.

c) Only Co111 and Ni111 systems have unrestricted spins.

## 2) Molecules: 

We included all relevant neutral gas-phase molecules for calculating adsorption of all anions considered.
